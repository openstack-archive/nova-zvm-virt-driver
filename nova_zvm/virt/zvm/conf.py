The path at which images will be stored (snapshot, deploy, etc).

Images used for deploy and images captured via snapshot

Timeout (seconds) to wait for an instance to start.

The z/VM driver relies on communication between the instance and cloud
connector. After an instance is created, it must have enough time to wait
for all the network info to be written into the user directory.
The driver will keep rechecking network status to the instance with the
timeout value, If setting network failed, it will notify the user that
starting the instance failed and put the instance in ERROR state.
The underlying z/VM guest will then be deleted.

Possible Values:
    Any positive integer. Recommended to be at least 300 seconds (5 minutes),
    but it will vary depending on instance and system load.
    A value of 0 is used for debug. In this case the underlying z/VM guest
    will not be deleted when the instance is marked in ERROR state.
