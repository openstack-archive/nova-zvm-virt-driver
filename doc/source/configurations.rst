The following is a sample ``nova_zvm.conf`` configuration file for the nova-zvm
driver, for adaptation and use.

It is auto-generated from the nova-zvm project when this documentation is
built, so if you are having issues with an option, please compare your version
of the ``nova-zvm`` Python package with the version of this documentation.

The sample configuration can also be viewed in
`file form <../../etc/nova-zvm.conf.sample>`_.
